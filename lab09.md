# Quotes

#### description 
Continue building on your work from lab 8. If your partner was the one who created the repo in that lab, create a fork of their repo and clone that fork to hold your work for today.

Start by refactoring anything that you don’t like about your solution from yesterday.
When running the application, don’t read in the quotes file. Instead, make a request to an API to get a random quote.
please do not delete your existing code, look at the very next feature task, you will still need that code

    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.7'
```

4. rebuild the gradle and your Gson is ready to use.
